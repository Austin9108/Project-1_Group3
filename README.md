House price vs. mortgage rate

Questions:

Is there a correlation between house price and mortgage rate?

Methods: create a scatter plot, calculate the r value, develop a linear regression line

Dataset: House price vs. mortgage rate

How are the following macroeconomic factors associated with each other? Unemployment rate, real disposable income, house price index, mortgage rate, inflation, population 

Method: Plot on a line graph the following macroeconomic factors and look at the graphs and make conclusions
