Names: Juhi, Mea, Kesha, Austin, Hima, and Lora

Tasks:

1. Maintaining the READ.me and GitHub - Austin

2. Cleaning House price vs. mortgage rate csv and creating data frame- Austin

3. Cleaning Market factors csv and creating data frame- Austin

4. Developing visualizations:

            1. House price vs. mortgage rate scatter plot, r value, linear regression line -Juhi

            2. Market factors: x-axis: time, y-axis: market factor (impose 2 graphs on each other)

            3. Real disposable income, unemployment line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly)

            4. House price index, Mortgage rate line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly)

            5. Inflation, Mortgage rate line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly)

            6. Unemployment rate, House price index line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly)

            7. Population, House price line graph (2 graphs-annual and monthly)

5. Slides on Google Presentation-each person makes their own slide based on what they coded

6. Graphic design on Google Presentation (make cohesive)- Mea 

7. Practice Presentation - everyone

Datasets:

1. Market factors

Monthly_Macroeconomic_Factors.csv

Annual_Macroeconomic_Factors.csv

2. House price vs. mortgage rate

US House Price and Mortgage Rate.csv

Questions:

1. Is there a correlation between house price and mortgage rate?

Methods: create a scatter plot, calculate the r value, develop a linear regression line

Dataset: House price vs. mortgage rate

2. How are the following macroeconomic factors associated with each other? Unemployment rate, real disposable income, house price index, mortgage rate, inflation, population 

Method: Plot on a line graph the following macroeconomic factors and look at the graphs and make conclusions

Dataset: Market factors
